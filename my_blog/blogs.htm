<H4>Why I'm changing career....MMMmmmm</H4>
<div class="reason">
<p>The reason is simple.... <em>I DONT ENJOY MY CURRENT JOB ANYMORE.</em> <br>
   There has been many influences as to how I ended not enjoying my job anymore, <br>
   mainly it comes down to management. Management tends to bend and even break rules to get what they want from employees. <br> Also this being South Africa and with the construction industry not doing to well, <br> management will exploit you as far as what they can without compassion and ofcourse compensation. <br> Back breaking work will be done without knowing when you will get home to your family. <br> There will be days on end where work will be a nearly 14-16 hour day. There is no over time paid to staff memebers and your <br> family and personal life comes second. This is why I've lost my morale to being a mechanic.</p>
