        <p>
            Mechanic to Developer is a personal blog about transitioning from being a Qaulified Artisan to a Web developer. <br> The process of the transition will be documented and added as I strive to improve on a skill that is out of my element of work. <br> Having worked in construction, there has become a mundane environment and lack of creativity.
            <br> While still young and have the hunger to learn and keep the hamster wheel turning, becoming a developer is the ideal dream job. <br>
