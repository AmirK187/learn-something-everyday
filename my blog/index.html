    <h2 id="C1" align=center>Chapter 1: About Myself</h2>
    <hr width=150px>

         <p align=center> <strong>Hi!!! I'm Amir.</strong> <br>I'm aspiring to become a developer. <br> This is the time I choose a different path to follow in my life. <br> I am currently employed as a <strong>Diesel artisan</strong> at a well established construction company. <br> Being hardworking and always willing to learn something new throughout my life. I've seen that becoming a artisan was the best idea at the time and still is <br>, <em>but</em> now it has become abit of a mundane career and tech has become fore-front to the back breaking, sweating and problem diagnosing work of a artisan, what I'm saying is it has become old school. <br> I still think its a great career, but with employers becoming less involved in the wellness and development of their employees, people are shying away from it. <br> Therefore I am  going in a root I should have done when I was conflicted with my career choice. <br> Better late than never!!! :) <br> So this is going to be my journey from mechanic to developer.

    <h2 class="C1" align=center>Chapter 2: Inspiration</h2>
    <hr width=150px>

        <p align=center>What inspired me to learn coding??? <br> It's the creative freedom of using digital tech to take an idea and bring it to reality through programming platforms. <br> Tech is also the future and with it anything is possible, it all starts from an idea and the willing to learn. <br> The learning aspect is endless and creativity is infinite. <br> The curiosity to learn, understand and apply is only human. <br> It's only unfortunate that we haven't taking out the time of our busy schedules to explore the possibilities of creativity through coding. There are those willing to take the leap to becoming program dev's. <br> Endless creativity and willingness to learn is all that is needed to become a <strong>successful developer</strong>.
